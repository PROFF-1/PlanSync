# PlanSync - Travel Itinerary Generator

## Project Overview

PlanSync is a React Native mobile application designed to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences. The application allows users to input their travel destination, interests, and trip duration to receive a structured day-by-day itinerary with recommended activities, restaurants, and attractions.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 54
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (File-based routing)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and code maintainability
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with consistent theming

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. User Preference Collection
- Multi-field form with dropdown selectors for destination, interests, and duration
- Comprehensive form validation with real-time error feedback
- Cross-platform picker components with native iOS modal interface and Android dropdown

#### 2. Itinerary Generation Engine
- **Algorithm**: Greedy selection with round-robin distribution
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) time complexity with linear space usage
- **Features**:
  - Interest-based location filtering with substring matching
  - Rating-based priority sorting (descending order)
  - Balanced activity distribution (2-4 activities per day)
  - Automatic restaurant integration with random selection
  - Time slot assignment (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

#### 3. Interactive Itinerary Display
- Expandable day cards with activity details
- Activity metadata including duration, rating, and descriptions
- Trip summary statistics (total days, activities, hours)
- Navigate to map view functionality

#### 4. Location Visualization
- Location list view with "Open in Maps" integration
- Activity categorization with visual indicators
- Detailed location information with coordinates
- External map application integration

#### Data Management
- Comprehensive location database covering Ghana with 50+ attractions
- Structured data model with coordinates, categories, ratings, and descriptions
- Type-safe interfaces for all data structures

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

#### iOS Optimizations
- Native modal picker interface replacing problematic default picker
- Proper SafeAreaView implementation using react-native-safe-area-context
- iOS-specific navigation patterns and touch interactions

#### Android Compatibility
- Native dropdown picker maintained for optimal user experience
- Material Design-aligned styling and interactions
- Platform-specific conditional rendering

### Code Quality and Best Practices

#### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- Type-safe navigation parameters and component props

#### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data or invalid inputs
- User-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
- Navigation error prevention with proper back stack management

#### Performance Considerations
- Efficient algorithm implementation with optimal complexity
- Lazy loading and component optimization
- Memory-efficient data structures

## Current Status

### Completed Features
- User preference collection system with validation
- Core itinerary generation algorithm
- Cross-platform picker components
- Interactive itinerary display with expandable cards
- Location visualization and external map integration
- Comprehensive theming system
- Error handling and edge case management

### Recent Fixes and Improvements
- Resolved iOS picker interaction issues through native modal implementation
- Fixed navigation errors by implementing proper back stack management
- Updated deprecated SafeAreaView to use react-native-safe-area-context
